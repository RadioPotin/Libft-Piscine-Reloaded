# Libft-Piscine-Reloaded #

LIBFT is among the first projects of 42. It consists in creating a basic utility library to use further up the projects' branches. The functions found in it are various. Some functions for string manipulation, some for memory management, others of mathematical nature and a few basic linked-lists handling functions.
A makefile to compile the said library was required as well.
Piscine Reloaded is basically the same thing, without having to compile a library. It consists in a set of functions of basic difficulty.
